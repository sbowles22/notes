## Capacitor with an insulator between the plates
Insulator of dialectric constant $K$
$$E = \frac{Q/A}{K\epsilon_0}$$$$C \propto K$$
## Current Density and Conductivity
$$\vec{J} = \sigma \vec{E}$$where $\sigma$ is the conductivity of a material. Define J as:$$\vec{J} = \frac{\vec{I}}{A}$$Conductivity can be shown then to be: $$\sigma = |q|nu$$where $|q|$ is charge, $n$ is charge density, and $u$ is mobility.$$J = \sigma E \rightarrow I = \sigma A E$$In a resistor of length $L$, $$\Delta V = -\int E \cdot dl \rightarrow |\Delta V| = EL$$Now $$I = \frac{\sigma A E L}{L} = \left(\frac{\sigma A}{L}\right)|\Delta V| \rightarrow |\Delta V| = \\TODO \left(\frac{\sigma A}{L}\right)$$
## Definition of Resistor
Important special case: if the conductivity remain constant regardless of how much current flows, then we call the material "ohmic" TODO

Ohmic:$$V \propto I$$
Non-ohmic:
$$V \not\propto I$$
## Current flow through conductors
$$R = \frac{L}{\sigma A}; I = \frac{\Delta V}{R}$$
## Goal: find $Q(t)$, $I(t)$ in RC Circuit: Charging
Just after connection: $$Q = 0; I = \frac{V}{R}$$After charging:$$Q = CV; I = 0$$
Theres one more concept we need: $$I = \frac{dQ}{dt}$$
### Solving
By Kirchoff's loop rule:$$V_{\text{emf}} - \frac{Q}{C} - IR = 0$$$$V_{\text{emf}} = \frac{Q}{C} + IR$$$$V_{\text{emf}} = \frac{Q}{C} + \frac{dQ}{dt}R$$Solve this differential equation for $Q(t)$. First order with constant coefficients $V_\text{emf}$, $C$, and $R$.$$Q(t) = Q_h(t) + Q_p$$$$Q_p: V_\text{emf} = \frac{Q_p}{C} \rightarrow Q_p = CV_\text{emf}$$Propose: TODO$$Q_h(t) = Ae^{\alpha t}$$TODO
$$Q(t)= -V_\text{emf}C(1-e^{-t/RC})$$We may then take the derivative of this equation to get the current. TODO$$I(t) =$$
## The RC Time Constant
$\tau = RC$ is the time constant. It has units ohm-farads. 

Im giving up, this is too much today D:
