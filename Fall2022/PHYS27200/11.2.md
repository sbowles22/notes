## Lorentz Forces
$$F = q\vec{E} + q\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$$
Direction of $F_B$ is perpendicular to plane contining $v$ and $B$.

If $q$ is positive, $F_B$ has the same direction as $\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$, vice versa for negative charges.

## CRT
Uses deflecting coils to aim a beam of emmitted electrons from a heated cathode.

## More on Megnetic Force
The **magnetic force on a charged object** tbat moves in a magnetic field **does _not_ do any work** because it is parallel to $v$. 

This means that $F_B$ does not change the kinetic energy of the particle, so in a uniform magnetic field, the charge will move in a circle (or helix).

## Determining the Momentum of a Particle
$R$ is the radius of curvature, $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.$$\vec{v} = R\omega\hat{\theta}$$$$p = \gamma mv \rightarrow |p| = \gamma m R \omega$$$$\frac{dp}{dt} = -\gamma m R \omega^2\hat{r} = p\omega$$$$\omega = \gamma \frac{|q|B}{m}$$$$p = |q|BR$$If $v<<c$, (nonrelativistic) $$\omega =\frac{|q|B}{m}$$CYCLOTRON FREQUENCY$$f = \frac{|q|B}{2\pi m}\;;\; T = 2\pi \frac{m}{|q|B}$$Rearranging for $R$, we can see why a mass spectrometer works!$$\omega R = v \;;R = \frac{mv}{|q|B}$$Using the kinetic energy equation, $$\frac{m}{q} = \frac{B^2R^2}{2|\Delta V|}$$Flipping this equation, we can arrive at J.J. Thomson's eqation used to find the charge to mass ratio of the electron ($\frac{q}{m} \approx -10^{11}$ C/kg) $$\frac{q}{m} = \frac{2|\Delta V|}{B^2R^2}$$ This was not right ofc, but he was pretty damn close B)

## Magnetic Force on a Wire
$$F_B = I\Delta l \times B$$But a wire produces a magnetic field!$$B = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{2I}{r}\hat\theta$$ Like currents attract two parallel wires, and unlike currents repel!
$$F = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} TODO$$
