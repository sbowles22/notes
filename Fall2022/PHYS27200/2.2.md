## Today
- Insulators
- Conductors
- Charging and Dischargin Objects

## Van der Waals Forces
Induced dipoles cause weak attraction

Atoms and molecules:
 - Electron clouds fluctuate continually
 - They make temporary dipoles
 - Molecules don't need to be polar
 - Fluctuation fall into sync, they see eachother and create an attractive force

## Electron Matter
Electron inside materials have their own phases of matter
- Conductor
- Insulator
- Magnets
- Superconductors

### Insulators
No mobile charges. Electrons are bound to atoms or molecules that make up the material.

Common types:
- Glass
- Wood
- Pure water
- Rubber
- Air

### Conductors
Charges can flow throughout the material.

Common Types:
- Metals
- Water with ions

### Polarization of Insulators
- Electrons shift slightly (<1 Angstrom) but remain bound
- Individual atoms or molecules polarize in an ecternal field
- Happens very quickly (<1 ns)
- Lots of molecules -> net effect can be large

$\vec{p} = \alpha \vec{E}$. Inside a material,$$\vec{p} = \alpha (\vec{E}_{\text{applied}} +\vec{E}_{\text{polarized}})$$
### Ionic Solutions
- Mobile ions are both positively and negatively charged
- If external feild is applied, ions pile up at the two sides of the liquid
- Liquid polarizes
- Inside: net feild = applied feild + feild created by relocated ions
- If the net feild != 0, ions move with constant speed (drift speed) due to collision with water molecules (friction at microscopic level)
$$\vec{v} = u \vec{E}_{\text{net}}$$
where $u$ or $\mu$ is the mobility and $\vec{E}_{\text{net}} = \vec{E}_{\text{applied}} +\vec{E}_{\text{polarized}}$ 

#### Proof that $\vec{E} = 0$ inside a conductor at equilibrium
Assume $\vec{E} \ne 0$. Since $\vec{v} = u \vec{E}_{\text{net}}$, $\vec{v} \ne 0$. Thus the conductor is not in equilibrium.

### Metals
"Sea" of electrons. i.e. very free electron movement

#### Polarization in metals
In an applied electric feild, the electron density of the metal will shift to completely oppose the applied electric feild. 

### Drude Model of Electron Motion in a Metal
$$\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = F_{\text{net}} = qE_{\text{net}} = e^- E_{\text{net}}$$
- Negligible net interaction between mobile electron
- Electrons forget previous velocity after collision with nucli
$$\Delta p = p - 0 = eE_{\text{net}}\Delta t$$
$$v = \frac{p}{m_e} = \frac{eE_{\text{net}}t}{m_e}$$
$$\bar{v} = \frac{e\bar{\Delta t}}{m}E_{\text{net}} = uE_{\text{net}}$$
where u is "mobility"

### Excess Charge on Conductors in Equilibrium
Excess charge will always be found on the surface of the conductor.

#### Conductors don't always have $\vec{E} = 0$
// Todo

## Charging and discharging

### By Contact: 
Before contact, neutral object will polarize from charged object. After contact between conductors, net charge will spread between the two objects. E.g. Grounding uses the earth as an electric source and sink to remove net charge from object.

### By Induction:
1. Bring charged object near conductor
2. Ground conductor
3. Break connection to ground
4. Remove the origional charged object
