- Charge density
- Electric feild of charge distrobution
- Electric feild of charged rod

## Superposition
Net electric feild is the sub of feilds from individual objects.

## Charge Distribution Problems
1. Understand the geometry
2. Choose dq (charge element)
3. Evaluate dE contribution from the infitesimal charge element
4. // TODO

## Charge density
- Rod has a charge $Q$ and length $L$
- Suppose we approximate it as 10 point charges in a row

$$Q = \sum^{10}_{i=1}\frac{\Delta q_i}{\Delta x} \Delta x = \sum^{10}_{i=1}\lambda \Delta x ; \Delta x = \frac{L}{10}$$
- Suppose that we approximate it as $n$ point charges in a row, and $n$ goes to infinity  $$Q = \int dq = \int_{x_0}^{x_0 + L} \lambda(x)dx$$
- Suppose that charge is uniformly distrobuted $$Q = \lambda \int_{x_0}^{x_0 + L} dx = \lambda L$$
## Electric Feild of a Finite Uniformally Charged Rod in Bisecting Plane
For every infintesimal charge $\delta q$, there is a corresponding infintesimal charge equidistance from the center of the rod, cancelling out the electric feild components not in the plane.

1. $$r^2 = x^2 + y^2; \cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{r}$$
2. $$\vec{E}_{\text{net}} = \sum \Delta E$$
3. $$\Delta E = |\Delta E| \cos(\theta) = \frac{k \Delta q}{r^2} \frac{x}{r}\hat{r}$$

...
Substitute $y=x\tan(\alpha)$; therefore $dy = x \sec^2(\alpha)d\alpha$
...
For a distance $r$ from the middle of the rod on its bisecting plane: $$E(r) = k\frac{Q}{r\sqrt{r^2 + (L/2)^2}}\hat{r}$$
### For an Infinite Rod
$$E = \frac{2\lambda}{r}\hat{r}$$
### If $r >> L$
The finite rod approximates to a point charge
$$E(r) = k\frac{Q}{r\sqrt{r^2 + (L/2)^2}}\hat{r} \approx k\frac{Q}{r\sqrt{r^2}}\hat{r} = \frac{kQ}{r^2}\hat{r}$$
