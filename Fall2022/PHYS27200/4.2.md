## Two, Very Close Uniformly Charged Metal Disks ($s << R$)
(Conductors) Charge is nearly uniformly distributed due to the neiboring disk! $$E_{\text{disk}} = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \left( 1 - \frac{z}{\sqrt{R^2 + z^2}}\right)\hat{z}$$ When $z << R$, $$E_{\text{disk}} \approx \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \left( 1 - \frac{z}{R}\right)\hat{z}$$ With $s$ being the seperation between the disks, $$E_{\text{mid}} \approx \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}\left[ 1 - \frac{z}{R} \right] + \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}\left[ 1 - \frac{s - z}{R} \right]$$ Simplifying, $$E_{\text{mid}} \approx \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} \left[ 1- \frac{s}{2R}\right] \hat{z}$$ And since $s << R$, $$E_{\text{mid}} \approx \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} \hat{z}\;; E_{\text{out}} \approx 0$$
## Hollow and Solid Spherical Objects with Uniform Charge

### Hollow (Shell)
This can be verified by gauss's law, but for today's purposes we recognize that, far away from the sphere, since it is a finite object, it can be treated as a point charge. Coupled with the fact that a shell is rotationally symetric, the $E$-feild outside is equated to the shell as a point charge about its center. Inside, the elements of a shell cancel themselves out.
$$E_\text{inside} = 0\;;E_\text{outside} = k\frac{q}{r^2} \hat{r}$$
### Solid
We are building an onion! We can divide a sphere of charge $Q$ and radius $R$ into some amount (perhaps infinite) of concentric shells. $$\rho = \frac{Q}{V} = \frac{Q}{4\pi |R|^3/3}$$ Lets take all of the sphere up to some inner radius $0 \le r < R$, the amount of charge contained within that radius $\Delta q$ is $$\Delta q = \rho (4\pi r^3/3) = \frac{Q(4\pi r^3/3)}{4\pi |R|^3/3} = \frac{Qr^3}{|R|^3}$$ Since all of the charge outside this inner radius can be represented as a shell, we know its effect on the inner electric feild is 0. And since the charge inside the inner radius is spherically semetric, it can be represented as a point charge about its center. Thus, $$E(r) = k\frac{\Delta q}{r^2} = k\frac{Qr^3}{r^2|R|^3} = k\frac{Qr}{|R|^3}\hat{r}$$
