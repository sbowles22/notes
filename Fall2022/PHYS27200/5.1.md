## Review: Single Particle Energy

// TODO

$$\Delta U + \Delta K = \Delta W_\text{surrounding}$$

### Example: Proton between charged plates
$$\Delta U = -\Delta W_\text{internal}$$$$= -\int q\vec{E}\;d\vec{r} =  -q\int \vec{E_x}\;dx $$$$U = -qE\Delta x$$
## Electric Potential
We define the voltage, or the electric potential difference, to be (in a uniform feild) $$\Delta V = -E\Delta x$$When applying this to the previous equation about potential energy, $$\Delta U = q \Delta V$$The units of voltage are Volts, denoted $V$ $$V = \left[ \text{Volt} \right] = \left[ \frac{\text{Joule}}{\text{Coulomb}} \right]$$ **Electron volt**: te energy required to move $q = 1e^-$ through $1V$, $$\Delta U = q\Delta V = (1.6 \times 10^{-19})(1V) = 1.6 \times 10^{-19}J = 1eV$$ The electric feild is always in the direction that the electric potential is decreasing the most (gradient). Countours can be used to find paths of constant electric potential as a result. 

If the electric field is *not* uniform,  $$\Delta V=-\int^C \vec{E}\; d\vec{l}$$
### Potential Energy of two Charges
If particle A is fixed but barticle B is not. And $q_1 > 0 > q_2$. // TODO

Defining $U_\infty = 0$     
$$U = \frac{q_1q_2}{4\pi\epsilon_0r}$$ 
### Potential Energy of Three Charges
$$U = U_{12} + U_{23} + U_{31} = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r_{12}} + k\frac{q_2q_3}{r_{23}} + k\frac{q_3q_1}{r_{31}}$$ $n$ charges leads to $C_{n,2} = \binom{n}{2}$ charge interactions.
