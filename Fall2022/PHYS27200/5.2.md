## Potential of a point charge
Starting with the definition of voltage$$\Delta V = -\int^C\vec{E}\;d\vec{l}$$We assume $V_\infty = 0$, and bringing the charge from infinity, we get$$\Delta V = -\int^r_\infty\vec{E}\;d\vec{r}$$With a point charge,$$\Delta V = -\int^r_\infty\frac{kq}{r^2}\;d\vec{r}$$Evaluating to,$$\Delta V = \frac{kq}{r}$$
## Potentials and Electric Feild
$$\Delta V = -\int^C\vec{E}\;d\vec{l}\rightarrow dV = -Edl$$$$V = V(x,y,z)$$$$dV= \left\langle\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}dx, \frac{\partial V}{\partial y}dy,\frac{\partial V}{\partial z}dz \right\rangle$$$$dV = -\vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} = -\vec{E} \cdot d \left\langle dx,dy,dz \right\rangle $$$$\vec{E} = -\vec{\nabla}V = \left\langle \frac{\partial V}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial V}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial V}{\partial z}\right\rangle$$
## Path Independence of Potential Difference
This is because electric feilds are conservative. This means that only the initial and final points matter in calculating $\Delta V$, otherwise known as path independence. Thus, $$-\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} = 0$$As a result, some patterns of electric feild can never be created from stationary charges.
